#SCRUM - artifacts, cermonies and roles

##SCRUM cermonies
Scrum is executed in what are called sprints, or short iterations of work lasting usually no more than two weeks. A sprint employs four different scrum ceremonies to ensure proper execution: sprint planning, daily scrum, sprint review and sprint retrospective. These scrum ceremonies are outlined below:

- sprint planning: This is where the team meets and decides what they need to complete in the coming sprint

- Daily Scrum: This is a standup meeting, or a very short – 15-minute mini-meeting – for the team to make sure they’re all on the same page.

- Sprint review: This is another type of meeting, but one in which the team demos what they shipped in the sprint.

- Sprint retrospective: This is when the team reviews their work, identifying what they did well and what didn’t go as planned, so they can make the next sprint better.

###SCRUM artifacts

In Scrum, artifacts are “information radiators” and they serve to capture the shared understanding of the team at a particular point in time. Scrum fameworks defines 3 essential artifacts.

- Product Backlog: The Product backlog is a set of all baseline requirements prioritized in order which is made available by the Product Owner to the Scrum Team.

- Sprint backlog: The Sprint Backlog is a subset of the Product Backlog that the team pulls into the sprint to work on. It is essentially the list of “To Do’s” a development team might be working during the current sprint.

- Each Sprint the development team produces potentially shippable product increment.  This product increment must align to the development team’s “Definition of Done” and this increment must be acceptable by the Product Owner.

####SCRUM roles

The three SCRUM roles are as follows:

- Product owner: The person with the product vision

- SCRUM master: The scrum expert who helps the team build the product according to the scrum framework

- Development team: The team members who execute the work
